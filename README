The first, basic version of the emotion monitor. This is a simple script designed to run every 15 minutes simply sending you a direct message asking for your current emotion and you activity.

The acceptable emotions are:
- Joy
- Trust
- Fear
- Surprise
- Sadness
- Disgust
- Anger
- Anticipation

In order to set this up for yourself, you'll have to register an application with twitter, get your oauth keys, and set up a configuration.yml file that looks like the following:

consumer_key: consumer_key_here
consumer_secret: consumer_secret_here
oauth_token: oauth_token_here
oauth_token_secret: oauth_token_secret
username: the_username_that_you_want_dms_to_be_sent_to

Or I could add you to my script.
